# Ads Skills for AI Agents

These skills teach your agent how to run ads. They cover advertising strategy for both Meta and Google (and soon LinkedIn, TikTok, X, and Reddit).

Install once, and your agent plans campaigns using real frameworks instead of hallucinating settings.

```bash
npx skills add adkit-so/ads-skills --all -y -g
```

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, OpenAI Codex, and any agent that support skills.

## Skills

### Strategy skills

Each covers a single platform end-to-end: campaign structure, audience targeting, creative strategy, budget management, and performance analysis.

| Skill                                                | Platform             | Description                                                                                                  |

## How it works

1. **Install the skills** — one command, all skills load into your agent
2. **Your agent reads the brief** — Skills includes a built-in brief workflow (product, audience, market, KPIs so it understands the campaign you want to run)
3. **Your agent plans the campaign** — following the platform-specific strategy skill
4. **BONUS: Your agent launch everything for you** — connect [AdKit](https://adkit.so) to let your agent creates and publishes campaigns directly (100% optional, works just fine without, the agent will guide you!)

## What's inside

Each strategy skill covers the full campaign lifecycle:

- **Platform mechanics**: how the auction/algorithm works and how to work with it
- **Campaign structure**: hierarchy, objective selection, optimization events
- **Audience targeting**: broad vs. interest-based vs. lookalike, when to use each
- **Budget management**: starting budgets, scaling rules, kill criteria
- **Ad creative**: hook frameworks, format selection (static vs. video vs. carousel), platform-specific specs
- **Ad copy**: headline formulas, description frameworks, CTA patterns
- **Performance diagnostics**: symptom → cause → action framework for reading metrics
- **Account setup**: compliance rules, pixel/tag configuration, ban prevention

## FAQ

**What agents are supported?**
Any agent that supports skills: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, OpenAI Codex, and 17+ others.

**Do I need AdKit to use these skills?**
No. The skills work standalone for strategy and planning. AdKit is only needed if you want your agent to create and publish campaigns without logging into Ads Manager.
